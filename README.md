# analytij

Clojure library to ease interacting with the Google Analytics API. It is built upon [Google's Analytics API Java Client Library](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/apis/analytics/v3).

Current [version](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.apis/google-api-services-analytics/v3-rev116-1.20.0)

Current functionality 

1. Upload a Cost Data CSV given:
  1. A Google Analytics Account with an existing property.
  2. The property has a view associated with it.
  3. The view has a custom data source associated with it.
2. Upload Status of a CSV given:
  1. The Google analytics account id.
  2. The property id. 
  3. The data source id.
  4. The upload id (which is returned when you use the upload-data fn.


## Prerequisites
You need a [service account](https://developers.google.com/console/help/?csw=1#service_accounts) to use analytij.

See [Service Accounts](https://github.com/rockBreaker/analytij/tree/readme#service-accounts).

A [cost data file] (https://developers.google.com/analytics/solutions/data-import-cost?hl=en#prep). 
## Usage

REPL

```clojure
 ;; example account id : 8 numbers
(def acc-id "XXXXXXXX")  

 ;; example property id: 2 letters and 9 numbers 
(def property-id "LL-XXXXXXXX-X") 

 ;; example custom data source id 
(def custom-data-source-id "vISHq_PRQSu1Te4FUE2g6A")

 ;; cost data file
(def c-data-file "pathToCostData.csv")

(def analytics-service (service account-id "pathToPrivateKeyFile"))

;; How to upload data
(upload-data analytics-service acc-id property-id custom-data-source-id c-data-file) 
=> Returns response map. :TODO get results from REPL.

;; How to check on upload progress.
;; You need the above response map :TODO get it. 
(def upload-id (:id response-map))

(upload-status analytics-service account-id property-id data-source-id upload-id)
=> Returns upload status. :TODO get results from REPL.

```



#Terminology
- *G.A*                    - [Google analytics](https://www.google.co.uk/analytics/)
- *analytics-service*      - This is created by the service fn. 
- *account-id*             - This is your google analytics account id (you can see this in Account Settings in G.A)
- *property-id*            - This is the property id listed inside G.A admin tab when you click on the property you want. 
- *custom-data-source-id*  - This is created when you click on Data import in the property section
- *cost-data-file*         - This is your csv file containing your cost data.

# Service Accounts
Instructions copied/inspired from [legato](https://github.com/tpitale/legato/wiki/OAuth2-and-Google#service-accounts) (*Approval Given*)

**Note**: Service accounts only work for Google Apps accounts. With a regular @gmail.com google account, you'll need an "Installed Application". 

## Registering for API Access

* Go to the [Google API Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/)
* Create a new Project and name it accordingly
* Turn on the **Analytics API** access by clicking APIs and Auth.
